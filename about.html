<h4> A UNIQUE HERITAGE SCHOOL.</h4>
<P> A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and <br>
    learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers.<br>
    Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.<br>
    In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. <br>
    The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) <br> 
    but generally include primary school for young children <br>
    and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.</P>
